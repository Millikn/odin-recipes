        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Juice your lemons. Start by firmly rolling the lemons around on the counter. This will help release the juices and make your job a lot easier. Cut the lemon in half lengthwise, then squeeze out the juice by hand or with a juicer. Make sure to juice the lemons over a large measuring cup so you can see exactly how much liquid you have.</li>
            <li>It's shockingly simple to make simple syrup on the stove. Just combine sugar and water in a small saucepan, bring the mixture to a boil, and stir it until the sugar is dissolved.</li>
            <li>Pour cold water into a pitcher. Stir in lemon juice and pulp, then add simple syrup to taste.</li>
            <li>Serve over ice. If you're feeling fancy, garnish each glass with a fresh lemon slice or a candied lemon peel.</li>
        </ol>
