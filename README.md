TOP Foundations: First Project.
The assignment is to build a simple recipe website practicing the skills learned in the first half of the foundations course. Everything from creating a repository on Github, html boilerplates, commits and commit messages, images, links, headers, unordered and ordered lists, etc. 

I need to work on committing more often and organizing my files better.
